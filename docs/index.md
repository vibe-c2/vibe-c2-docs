# Vibe C2 Documentation

This repository contains the initial documentation baseline for the **Vibe C2** project.

## Purpose

Use this docs site to:

- Define product and technical requirements early.
- Capture architecture decisions before implementation.
- Track project scope and constraints.
- Keep the project community-centered and contributor-friendly.

## Community Mission

The project exists to enable people to:

- vibe-code their own modules
- vibe-deploy their own C2 infrastructure
- share and improve patterns with the community

## First Milestones

1. Finalize modular project scope (core server + modules).
2. Approve technical requirements (including RabbitMQ messaging and Compose deployment).
3. Establish architecture baseline and ADR process.

## Structure

- **Foundations** — project scope, technical requirements, architecture draft, core responsibilities, module taxonomy, full-system message flow.
- **Channels** — channel-specific message flow, message contracts, obfuscation profiles (concepts, YAML reference, examples), per-channel module docs, and a 15-minute channel authoring guide.
- **Go Packages Ecosystem** — docs for shared Go packages: protocol message contracts and channel runtime SDK.
- **ADR** — Architecture Decision Records for major technical choices.
