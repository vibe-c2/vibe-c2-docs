# Tech Requirements

## Functional Requirements

## FR-01: Operator Authentication

- The system must support operator login with secure credential handling.
- The system must support role-based authorization for privileged operations.

## FR-02: Agent Registration

- The system must support controlled agent enrollment.
- The system must persist agent identity metadata and health status.

## FR-03: Tasking and Result Flow

- Operators must be able to create and queue tasks.
- Agents must poll, execute tasks, and return results reliably.
- The system must retain task history with timestamps.

## FR-04: Modular Service Architecture

- The system must provide a **core server** as the central orchestration/control component.
- The system must support independent **modules** for capability-specific processing.
- Modules must communicate through the shared message bus and remain independently deployable.

## FR-05: RabbitMQ Messaging Backbone

- Core server and modules must communicate over RabbitMQ channels/queues.
- Implant traffic between channel and core must use request/response via HTTP (`POST /api/channel/sync`).
- Core HTTP response returns encrypted outbound payload for the same `id` (or encrypted no-op payload).
- Queue topology must support routing by message type and module responsibility.
- Critical message flows must support acknowledgements and retry/dead-letter behavior.

## FR-06: Application-Layer Implant Encryption

- Implant/session-to-C2 payloads must be encrypted at application level end-to-end.
- Channel modules must not decrypt implant payloads.
- Channel modules may process only minimal routing metadata (`id`, channel metadata) and encrypted blobs.
- Channel modules act as transport-only relays and must not own C2 protocol semantics.
- Core C2 services must resolve key material/context using `id` and perform decrypt/verify.

## FR-07: Channel Obfuscation Profiles

- Channel modules must support multiple enabled obfuscation profiles per channel.
- Profiles must define mapping/obfuscation rules for `profile_id` (optional hint), `id`, and `encrypted_data` in transport fields.
- Profiles must be persisted in storage as YAML documents.
- Channel modules must expose RabbitMQ RPC management actions for profile CRUD/activation/validation.
- Channel must brute-force all enabled profiles when hint is absent or invalid.

## FR-08: Obfuscation Match Resolution and Performance

- On inbound, channel should first resolve profile by transport `profile_id` hint when available.
- If hint is absent/invalid, channel must select profile by matching enabled profiles and decoding to canonical fields.
- Profile create/update must validate and reject ambiguous overlap with existing enabled profiles.
- Channel should optimize profile selection using usage frequency and source-to-profile affinity cache.

## FR-09: Auditability

- Security-relevant actions must be logged with actor, action, and time.
- Logs must be queryable for incident investigation.
- Module-originated actions must be traceable to message IDs/correlation IDs.
- Obfuscation profile changes must be auditable.

## Non-Functional Requirements

## NFR-01: Security

- All control-plane traffic must use encryption in transit.
- Implant payload confidentiality/integrity must be enforced with application-layer encryption.
- Decryption keys must be isolated to core C2 services (not channel modules).
- Secrets must not be stored in plaintext.
- Authentication events must be auditable.

## NFR-02: Reliability

- Core server target uptime: >= 99.5% for MVP environments.
- Task state and messaging state must survive process restarts.
- Module failures should be isolated and must not crash unrelated services.

## NFR-03: Performance

- Operator command response time target: p95 < 500 ms for metadata operations.
- Agent check-in handling must scale to expected MVP load.

## NFR-04: Maintainability

- Codebase must include lint/test automation.
- Core design decisions must be documented via ADR.

## Constraints

- Hosted documentation and CI/CD on GitHub.
- Runtime architecture is containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose for MVP.
- Messaging between core server and modules uses RabbitMQ.
- Stack choices must prioritize fast iteration for MVP.

## Open Questions

1. Expected maximum number of concurrent agents for MVP?
2. Required persistence technology and retention window?
3. Required authentication providers for operators?
